Instructions on how to use the program
To run the program the user must navigate to the program location on their computer. The user then must enter “python menu.py” command to run the program. On execution the user will be displayed several options to which they can choose from.

•	Option 1:	The user enters ‘1’ into the console when prompted to from the menu.		From here a series of infix notation regular expressions will be			compared against a series of strings. The output will be printed out to 		the console which will display the infix regular expression, the string 		the regular expression was compared to and ‘True’ or ‘False’ 			depending whether the regular expression could pass through the 			string. Example (a.b.c*, abcc would return True, and a+ , b would			return False).

•	Option 2:	The user enters ‘2’ into the console when prompted to from the menu.		The user will then be prompted to enter their own custom infix regular		expression. The user will then be prompted to enter their custom string		that they wish to compare against their regular expression. The output 		will display the regular expression, the string and ‘True’ or ‘False’			depending whether the regular expression can pass through the string.		Example (a. , aaa would return true).



•	 Option 3:	The user enters ‘3’ into the console when prompted to from the menu.		When this option is selected the user will exit the menu and the			program, after being displayed a message saying “Goodbye!!” to the		user.

•	Other:	If the user enters anything outside of the options that user is prompted		for an error message will be displayed to the user saying “Error			Invalid Input”. The user will then be given the opportunity to enter the		correct input again.
